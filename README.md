# s_tree

S-Tree: A self-balancing binary search tree. AVL-trees promise a close-to-optimal tree layout for lookup, but they consume a significant amount of memory and require relatively slow balancing operations. Red-black trees offer quicker manipulation with a slightly less optimal tree layout, and the proposed S-Tree offers fast insertion and deletion by balancing trees during lookup.
